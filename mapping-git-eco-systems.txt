| Hierarchy is maintained through repos |  Projects and teams can have organization roles | Projects have user roles |
| code modifications are sent through email patches and pull requests |    Code modifications are mainly fetched through pull requests    |   branch merge in the same repo |
| repos are maintained on git.kernel.org and then fetched to be able to modify source code| repos are hosted on github.com | Organizations maintain a self-hosted version of gitlab |
