   A Git core tutorial for developers

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This tutorial explains how to use the "core" Git commands to set up and
work with a Git repository.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you just need to use Git as a revision control system you may prefer
to start with "A Tutorial Introduction to Git" (<a href="gittutorial.html">gittutorial(7)</a>) or
<a href="user-manual.html">the Git User Manual</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, an understanding of these low-level tools can be helpful if
you want to understand Git&#8217;s internals.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The core Git is often called "plumbing", with the prettier user
interfaces on top of it called "porcelain". You may not want to use the
plumbing directly very often, but it can be good to know what the
plumbing does when the porcelain isn&#8217;t flushing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Back when this document was originally written, many porcelain
commands were shell scripts. For simplicity, it still uses them as
examples to illustrate how plumbing is fit together to form the
porcelain commands. The source tree includes some of these scripts in
contrib/examples/ for reference. Although these are not implemented as
shell scripts anymore, the description of what the plumbing layer
commands do is still valid.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_creating_a_git_repository">Creating a Git repository</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Creating a new Git repository couldn&#8217;t be easier: all Git repositories start
out empty, and the only thing you need to do is find yourself a
subdirectory that you want to use as a working tree - either an empty
one for a totally new project, or an existing working tree that you want
to import into Git.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For our first example, we&#8217;re going to start a totally new repository from
scratch, with no pre-existing files, and we&#8217;ll call it <em>git-tutorial</em>.
To start up, create a subdirectory for it, change into that
subdirectory, and initialize the Git infrastructure with <em>git init</em>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ mkdir git-tutorial
$ cd git-tutorial
$ git init</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>to which Git will reply</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which is just Git&#8217;s way of saying that you haven&#8217;t been doing anything
strange, and that it will have created a local <code>.git</code> directory setup for
your new project. You will now have a <code>.git</code> directory, and you can
inspect that with <em>ls</em>. For your new empty project, it should show you
three entries, among other things:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
a file called <code>HEAD</code>, that has <code>ref: refs/heads/master</code> in it.
   This is similar to a symbolic link and points at
   <code>refs/heads/master</code> relative to the <code>HEAD</code> file.

<div class="paragraph"><p>You have now created your first Git repository. Of course, since it&#8217;s
empty, that&#8217;s not very useful, so let&#8217;s start populating it with data.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_populating_a_git_repository">Populating a Git repository</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;ll keep this simple and stupid, so we&#8217;ll start off with populating a
few trivial files just to get a feel for it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Start off with just creating any random files that you want to maintain
in your Git repository. We&#8217;ll start off with a few bad examples, just to
get a feel for how this works:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ echo "Hello World" &gt;hello
$ echo "Silly example" &gt;example</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>you have now created two files in your working tree (aka <em>working directory</em>),
but to actually check in your hard work, you will have to go through two steps:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
fill in the <em>index</em> file (aka <em>cache</em>) with the information about your
   working tree state.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
commit that index file as an object.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first step is trivial: when you want to tell Git about any changes
to your working tree, you use the <em>git update-index</em> program. That
program normally just takes a list of filenames you want to update, but
to avoid trivial mistakes, it refuses to add new entries to the index
(or remove existing ones) unless you explicitly tell it that you&#8217;re
adding a new entry with the <code>--add</code> flag (or removing an entry with the
<code>--remove</code>) flag.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So to populate the index with the two files you just created, you can do</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git update-index --add hello example</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and you have now told Git to track those two files.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In fact, as you did that, if you now look into your object directory,
you&#8217;ll notice that Git will have added two new objects to the object
database. If you did exactly the steps above, you should now be able to do</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ ls .git/objects/??/*</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and see two files:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>.git/objects/55/7db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
.git/objects/f2/4c74a2e500f5ee1332c86b94199f52b1d1d962</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which correspond with the objects with names of <code>557db...</code> and
<code>f24c7...</code> respectively.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you want to, you can use <em>git cat-file</em> to look at those objects, but
you&#8217;ll have to use the object name, not the filename of the object:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git cat-file -t 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>where the <code>-t</code> tells <em>git cat-file</em> to tell you what the "type" of the
object is. Git will tell you that you have a "blob" object (i.e., just a
regular file), and you can see the contents with</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git cat-file blob 557db03</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which will print out "Hello World". The object <code>557db03</code> is nothing
more than the contents of your file <code>hello</code>.</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">Don&#8217;t confuse that object with the file <code>hello</code> itself. The
object is literally just those specific <strong>contents</strong> of the file, and
however much you later change the contents in file <code>hello</code>, the object
we just looked at will never change. Objects are immutable.</td>

<td class="content">The second example demonstrates that you can
abbreviate the object name to only the first several

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, as we mentioned previously, you normally never actually take a
look at the objects themselves, and typing long 40-character hex
names is not something you&#8217;d normally want to do. The above digression
was just to show that <em>git update-index</em> did something magical, and
actually saved away the contents of your files into the Git object
database.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Updating the index did something else too: it created a <code>.git/index</code>
file. This is the index that describes your current working tree, and
something you should be very aware of. Again, you normally never worry
about the index file itself, but you should be aware of the fact that
you have not actually really "checked in" your files into Git so far,
you&#8217;ve only <strong>told</strong> Git about them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, since Git knows about them, you can now start using some of the
most basic Git commands to manipulate the files or look at their status.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In particular, let&#8217;s not even check in the two files into Git yet, we&#8217;ll
start off by adding another line to <code>hello</code> first:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ echo "It's a new day for git" &gt;&gt;hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and you can now, since you told Git about the previous state of <code>hello</code>, ask
Git what has changed in the tree compared to your old index, using the
<em>git diff-files</em> command:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git diff-files</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Oops. That wasn&#8217;t very readable. It just spit out its own internal
version of a <em>diff</em>, but that internal version really just tells you
that it has noticed that "hello" has been modified, and that the old object
contents it had have been replaced with something else.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To make it readable, we can tell <em>git diff-files</em> to output the
differences as a patch, using the <code>-p</code> flag:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git diff-files -p
diff --git a/hello b/hello
index 557db03..263414f 100644

 Hello World
+It's a new day for git</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>i.e. the diff of the change we caused by adding another line to <code>hello</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In other words, <em>git diff-files</em> always shows us the difference between
what is recorded in the index, and what is currently in the working
tree. That&#8217;s very useful.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A common shorthand for <code>git diff-files -p</code> is to just write <code>git
diff</code>, which will do the same thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="_committing_git_state">Committing Git state</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, we want to go to the next stage in Git, which is to take the files
that Git knows about in the index, and commit them as a real tree. We do
that in two phases: creating a <em>tree</em> object, and committing that <em>tree</em>
object as a <em>commit</em> object together with an explanation of what the
tree was all about, along with information of how we came to that state.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Creating a tree object is trivial, and is done with <em>git write-tree</em>.
There are no options or other input: <code>git write-tree</code> will take the
current index state, and write an object that describes that whole
index. In other words, we&#8217;re now tying together all the different
filenames with their contents (and their permissions), and we&#8217;re
creating the equivalent of a Git "directory" object:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git write-tree</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and this will just output the name of the resulting tree, in this case
(if you have done exactly as I&#8217;ve described) it should be</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>8988da15d077d4829fc51d8544c097def6644dbb</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which is another incomprehensible object name. Again, if you want to,
you can use <code>git cat-file -t 8988d...</code> to see that this time the object
is not a "blob" object, but a "tree" object (you can also use
<code>git cat-file</code> to actually output the raw object contents, but you&#8217;ll see
mainly a binary mess, so that&#8217;s less interesting).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;normally you&#8217;d never use <em>git write-tree</em> on its own, because
normally you always commit a tree into a commit object using the
<em>git commit-tree</em> command. In fact, it&#8217;s easier to not actually use
<em>git write-tree</em> on its own at all, but to just pass its result in as an
argument to <em>git commit-tree</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>git commit-tree</em> normally takes several arguments&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it wants to know
what the <em>parent</em> of a commit was, but since this is the first commit
ever in this new repository, and it has no parents, we only need to pass in
the object name of the tree. However, <em>git commit-tree</em> also wants to get a
commit message on its standard input, and it will write out the resulting
object name for the commit to its standard output.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And this is where we create the <code>.git/refs/heads/master</code> file
which is pointed at by <code>HEAD</code>. This file is supposed to contain
the reference to the top-of-tree of the master branch, and since
that&#8217;s exactly what <em>git commit-tree</em> spits out, we can do this
all with a sequence of simple shell commands:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ tree=$(git write-tree)
$ commit=$(echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree $tree)
$ git update-ref HEAD $commit</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case this creates a totally new commit that is not related to
anything else. Normally you do this only <strong>once</strong> for a project ever, and
all later commits will be parented on top of an earlier commit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Again, normally you&#8217;d never actually do this by hand. There is a
helpful script called <code>git commit</code> that will do all of this for you. So
you could have just written <code>git commit</code>
instead, and it would have done the above magic scripting for you.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_making_a_change">Making a change</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Remember how we did the <em>git update-index</em> on file <code>hello</code> and then we
changed <code>hello</code> afterward, and could compare the new state of <code>hello</code> with the
state we saved in the index file?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Further, remember how I said that <em>git write-tree</em> writes the contents
of the <strong>index</strong> file to the tree, and thus what we just committed was in
fact the <strong>original</strong> contents of the file <code>hello</code>, not the new ones. We did
that on purpose, to show the difference between the index state, and the
state in the working tree, and how they don&#8217;t have to match, even
when we commit things.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As before, if we do <code>git diff-files -p</code> in our git-tutorial project,
we&#8217;ll still see the same difference we saw last time: the index file
hasn&#8217;t changed by the act of committing anything. However, now that we
have committed something, we can also learn to use a new command:
<em>git diff-index</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unlike <em>git diff-files</em>, which showed the difference between the index
file and the working tree, <em>git diff-index</em> shows the differences
between a committed <strong>tree</strong> and either the index file or the working
tree. In other words, <em>git diff-index</em> wants a tree to be diffed
against, and before we did the commit, we couldn&#8217;t do that, because we
didn&#8217;t have anything to diff against.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But now we can do</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git diff-index -p HEAD</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(where <code>-p</code> has the same meaning as it did in <em>git diff-files</em>), and it
will show us the same difference, but for a totally different reason.
Now we&#8217;re comparing the working tree not against the index file,
but against the tree we just wrote. It just so happens that those two
are obviously the same, so we get the same result.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Again, because this is a common operation, you can also just shorthand
it with</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git diff HEAD</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which ends up doing the above for you.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In other words, <em>git diff-index</em> normally compares a tree against the
working tree, but when given the <code>--cached</code> flag, it is told to
instead compare against just the index cache contents, and ignore the
current working tree state entirely. Since we just wrote the index
file to HEAD, doing <code>git diff-index --cached -p HEAD</code> should thus return
an empty set of differences, and that&#8217;s exactly what it does.</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>git diff-index</em> really always uses the index for its
comparisons, and saying that it compares a tree against the working
tree is thus not strictly accurate. In particular, the list of
files to compare (the "meta-data") <strong>always</strong> comes from the index file,
regardless of whether the <code>--cached</code> flag is used or not. The <code>--cached</code>
flag really only determines whether the file <strong>contents</strong> to be compared
come from the working tree or not.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is not hard to understand, as soon as you realize that Git simply
never knows (or cares) about files that it is not told about
explicitly. Git will never go <strong>looking</strong> for files to compare, it
expects you to tell it what the files are, and that&#8217;s what the index
is there for.</p></div>
</td>
</tr></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, our next step is to commit the <strong>change</strong> we did, and again, to
understand what&#8217;s going on, keep in mind the difference between "working
tree contents", "index file" and "committed tree". We have changes
in the working tree that we want to commit, and we always have to
work through the index file, so the first thing we need to do is to
update the index cache:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git update-index hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(note how we didn&#8217;t need the <code>--add</code> flag this time, since Git knew
about the file already).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note what happens to the different <em>git diff-&#42;</em> versions here.
After we&#8217;ve updated <code>hello</code> in the index, <code>git diff-files -p</code> now shows no
differences, but <code>git diff-index -p HEAD</code> still <strong>does</strong> show that the
current state is different from the state we committed. In fact, now
<em>git diff-index</em> shows the same difference whether we use the <code>--cached</code>
flag or not, since now the index is coherent with the working tree.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, since we&#8217;ve updated <code>hello</code> in the index, we can commit the new
version. We could do it by writing the tree by hand again, and
committing the tree (this time we&#8217;d have to use the <code>-p HEAD</code> flag to
tell commit that the HEAD was the <strong>parent</strong> of the new commit, and that
this wasn&#8217;t an initial commit any more), but you&#8217;ve done that once
already, so let&#8217;s just use the helpful script this time:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git commit</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which starts an editor for you to write the commit message and tells you
a bit about what you have done.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Write whatever message you want, and all the lines that start with <em>#</em>
will be pruned out, and the rest will be used as the commit message for
the change. If you decide you don&#8217;t want to commit anything after all at
this point (you can continue to edit things and update the index), you
can just leave an empty message. Otherwise <code>git commit</code> will commit
the change for you.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You&#8217;ve now made your first real Git commit. And if you&#8217;re interested in
looking at what <code>git commit</code> really does, feel free to investigate:
it&#8217;s a few very simple shell scripts to generate the helpful (?) commit
message headers, and a few one-liners that actually do the
commit itself (<em>git commit</em>).</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Git repositories are normally totally self-sufficient and relocatable.
Unlike CVS, for example, there is no separate notion of
"repository" and "working tree". A Git repository normally <strong>is</strong> the
working tree, with the local Git information hidden in the <code>.git</code>
subdirectory. There is nothing else. What you see is what you got.</p></div>

the directory that it tracks, but we&#8217;ll ignore that for now: it&#8217;s not
how normal projects work, and it&#8217;s really only meant for special uses.
So the mental model of "the Git information is always tied directly to
the working tree that it describes" may not be technically 100%
accurate, but it&#8217;s a good model for all normal use.</td>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This has two implications:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
if you grow bored with the tutorial repository you created (or you&#8217;ve
   made a mistake and want to start all over), you can just do simple
</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ rm -rf git-tutorial</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and it will be gone. There&#8217;s no external repository, and there&#8217;s no
history outside the project you created.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
if you want to move or duplicate a Git repository, you can do so. There
   is <em>git clone</em> command, but if all you want to do is just to
   create a copy of your repository (with all the full history that
   went along with it), you can do so with a regular
   <code>cp -a git-tutorial new-git-tutorial</code>.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that when you&#8217;ve moved or copied a Git repository, your Git index
file (which caches various information, notably some of the "stat"
information for the files involved) will likely need to be refreshed.
So after you do a <code>cp -a</code> to create a new copy, you&#8217;ll want to do</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git update-index --refresh</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>in the new repository to make sure that the index file is up-to-date.</p></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the second point is true even across machines. You can
duplicate a remote Git repository with <strong>any</strong> regular copy mechanism, be it
<em>scp</em>, <em>rsync</em> or <em>wget</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When copying a remote repository, you&#8217;ll want to at a minimum update the
index cache when you do this, and especially with other peoples'
repositories you often want to make sure that the index cache is in some
known state (you don&#8217;t know <strong>what</strong> they&#8217;ve done and not yet checked in),
so usually you&#8217;ll precede the <em>git update-index</em> with a</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git read-tree --reset HEAD
$ git update-index --refresh</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which will force a total index re-build from the tree pointed to by <code>HEAD</code>.
It resets the index contents to <code>HEAD</code>, and then the <em>git update-index</em>
makes sure to match up all index entries with the checked-out files.
If the original repository had uncommitted changes in its
working tree, <code>git update-index --refresh</code> notices them and
tells you they need to be updated.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The above can also be written as simply</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git reset</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and in fact a lot of the common Git command combinations can be scripted
with the <code>git xyz</code> interfaces.  You can learn things by just looking
at what the various git scripts do.  For example, <code>git reset</code> used to be
the above two lines implemented in <em>git reset</em>, but some things like
<em>git status</em> and <em>git commit</em> are slightly more complex scripts around
the basic Git commands.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many (most?) public remote repositories will not contain any of
the checked out files or even an index file, and will <strong>only</strong> contain the
actual core Git files. Such a repository usually doesn&#8217;t even have the
<code>.git</code> subdirectory, but has all the Git files directly in the
repository.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To create your own local live copy of such a "raw" Git repository, you&#8217;d
first create your own subdirectory for the project, and then copy the
raw repository contents into the <code>.git</code> directory. For example, to
create your own copy of the Git repository, you&#8217;d do the following</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ mkdir my-git
$ cd my-git
$ rsync -rL rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ .git</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>followed by</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git read-tree HEAD</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>to populate the index. However, now you have populated the index, and
you have all the Git internal files, but you will notice that you don&#8217;t
actually have any of the working tree files to work on. To get
those, you&#8217;d check them out with</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git checkout-index -u -a</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>where the <code>-u</code> flag means that you want the checkout to keep the index
up-to-date (so that you don&#8217;t have to refresh it afterward), and the
<code>-a</code> flag means "check out all files" (if you have a stale copy or an
older version of a checked out tree you may also need to add the <code>-f</code>
flag first, to tell <em>git checkout-index</em> to <strong>force</strong> overwriting of any old
files).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Again, this can all be simplified with</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ my-git
$ cd my-git
$ git checkout</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which will end up doing all of the above for you.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You have now successfully copied somebody else&#8217;s (mine) remote

<div class="paragraph"><p>Branches in Git are really nothing more than pointers into the Git
object database from within the <code>.git/refs/</code> subdirectory, and as we
already discussed, the <code>HEAD</code> branch is nothing but a symlink to one of
these object pointers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can at any time create a new branch by just picking an arbitrary
point in the project history, and just writing the SHA-1 name of that

want (and indeed, subdirectories), but the convention is that the
"normal" branch is called <code>master</code>. That&#8217;s just a convention, though,
and nothing enforces it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To show that as an example, let&#8217;s go back to the git-tutorial repository we
used earlier, and create a branch in it. You do that by simply just
saying that you want to check out a new branch:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_merging_two_branches">Merging two branches</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the ideas of having a branch is that you do some (possibly
experimental) work in it, and eventually merge it back to the main
branch. So assuming you created the above <code>mybranch</code> that started out
being the same as the original <code>master</code> branch, let&#8217;s make sure we&#8217;re in
that branch, and do some work there.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ echo "Work, work, work" &gt;&gt;hello
$ git commit -m "Some work." -i hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here, we just added another line to <code>hello</code>, and we used a shorthand for
doing both <code>git update-index hello</code> and <code>git commit</code> by just giving the
filename directly to <code>git commit</code>, with an <code>-i</code> flag (it tells
Git to <em>include</em> that file in addition to what you have done to
the index file so far when making the commit).  The <code>-m</code> flag is to give the
commit log message from the command line.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, to make it a bit more interesting, let&#8217;s assume that somebody else
does some work in the original branch, and simulate that by going back
to the master branch, and editing the same file differently there:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git checkout master</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here, take a moment to look at the contents of <code>hello</code>, and notice how they
don&#8217;t contain the work we just did in <code>mybranch</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because that work
hasn&#8217;t happened in the <code>master</code> branch at all. Then do</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ echo "Play, play, play" &gt;&gt;hello
$ echo "Lots of fun" &gt;&gt;example
$ git commit -m "Some fun." -i hello example</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>since the master branch is obviously in a much better mood.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, you&#8217;ve got two branches, and you decide that you want to merge the
work done. Before we do that, let&#8217;s introduce a cool graphical tool that
helps you view what&#8217;s going on:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ gitk --all</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>will show you graphically both of your branches (that&#8217;s what the <code>--all</code>
means: normally it will just show you your current <code>HEAD</code>) and their
histories. You can also see exactly how they came to be from a common
source.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, let&#8217;s exit <em>gitk</em> (<code>^Q</code> or the File menu), and decide that we want
to merge the work we did on the <code>mybranch</code> branch into the <code>master</code>
branch (which is currently our <code>HEAD</code> too). To do that, there&#8217;s a nice
script called <em>git merge</em>, which wants to know which branches you want
to resolve and what the merge is all about:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git merge -m "Merge work in mybranch" mybranch</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>where the first argument is going to be used as the commit message if
the merge can be resolved automatically.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, in this case we&#8217;ve intentionally created a situation where the
merge will need to be fixed up by hand, though, so Git will do as much
of it as it can automatically (which in this case is just merge the <code>example</code>
file, which had no differences in the <code>mybranch</code> branch), and say:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>        Auto-merging hello
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It tells you that it did an "Automatic merge", which
failed due to conflicts in <code>hello</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Not to worry. It left the (trivial) conflict in <code>hello</code> in the same form you
should already be well used to if you&#8217;ve ever used CVS, so let&#8217;s just
open <code>hello</code> in our editor (whatever that may be), and fix it up somehow.
I&#8217;d suggest just making it so that <code>hello</code> contains all four lines:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Hello World
It's a new day for git
Play, play, play
Work, work, work</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and once you&#8217;re happy with your manual merge, just do a</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git commit -i hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which will very loudly warn you that you&#8217;re now committing a merge
(which is correct, so never mind), and you can write a small merge
message about your adventures in <em>git merge</em>-land.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After you&#8217;re done, start up <code>gitk --all</code> to see graphically what the
history looks like. Notice that <code>mybranch</code> still exists, and you can
switch to it, and continue to work with it if you want to. The
<code>mybranch</code> branch will not contain the merge, but next time you merge it
from the <code>master</code> branch, Git will know how you merged it, so you&#8217;ll not
have to do <em>that</em> merge again.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another useful tool, especially if you do not always work in X-Window
environment, is <code>git show-branch</code>.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git show-branch --topo-order --more=1 master mybranch

*  [master^] Some fun.</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first two lines indicate that it is showing the two branches
with the titles of their top-of-the-tree commits, you are currently on
<code>master</code> branch (notice the asterisk <code>*</code> character), and the first
column for the later output lines is used to show commits contained in the
<code>master</code> branch, and the second column for the <code>mybranch</code>
branch. Three commits are shown along with their titles.
All of them have non blank characters in the first column (<code>*</code>
shows an ordinary commit on the current branch, <code>-</code> is a merge commit), which
means they are now part of the <code>master</code> branch. Only the "Some
work" commit has the plus <code>+</code> character in the second column,
because <code>mybranch</code> has not been merged to incorporate these
commits from the master branch.  The string inside brackets
before the commit log message is a short name you can use to
name the commit.  In the above example, <em>master</em> and <em>mybranch</em>
are branch heads.  <em>master^</em> is the first parent of <em>master</em>
branch head.  Please see <a href="gitrevisions.html">gitrevisions(7)</a> if you want to

<h2 id="_how_does_the_merge_work">How does the merge work?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>We said this tutorial shows what plumbing does to help you cope
with the porcelain that isn&#8217;t flushing, but we so far did not
talk about how the merge really works.  If you are following
this tutorial the first time, I&#8217;d suggest to skip to "Publishing
your work" section and come back here later.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>OK, still with me?  To give us an example to look at, let&#8217;s go
back to the earlier repository with "hello" and "example" file,
and bring ourselves back to the pre-merge state:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git show-branch --more=2 master mybranch
! [master] Merge work in mybranch
 * [mybranch] Merge work in mybranch
--
-- [master] Merge work in mybranch
+* [master^2] Some work.
+* [master^] Some fun.</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Remember, before running <em>git merge</em>, our <code>master</code> head was at
"Some fun." commit, while our <code>mybranch</code> head was at "Some
work." commit.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ git reset --hard master^2
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard master^</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After rewinding, the commit structure should look like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git show-branch
* [master] Some fun.
 ! [mybranch] Some work.
--
*  [master] Some fun.
 + [mybranch] Some work.
*+ [master^] Initial commit</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now we are ready to experiment with the merge by hand.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>git merge</code> command, when merging two branches, uses 3-way merge
algorithm.  First, it finds the common ancestor between them.
The command it uses is <em>git merge-base</em>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ mb=$(git merge-base HEAD mybranch)</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The command writes the commit object name of the common ancestor
to the standard output, so we captured its output to a variable,
because we will be using it in the next step.  By the way, the common
ancestor commit is the "Initial commit" commit in this case.  You can
tell it by:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git name-rev --name-only --tags $mb
my-first-tag</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After finding out a common ancestor commit, the second step is
this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git read-tree -m -u $mb HEAD mybranch</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the same <em>git read-tree</em> command we have already seen,
but it takes three trees, unlike previous examples.  This reads
the contents of each tree into different <em>stage</em> in the index
file (the first tree goes to stage 1, the second to stage 2,
etc.).  After reading three trees into three stages, the paths
that are the same in all three stages are <em>collapsed</em> into stage
0.  Also paths that are the same in two of three stages are
collapsed into stage 0, taking the SHA-1 from either stage 2 or
stage 3, whichever is different from stage 1 (i.e. only one side
changed from the common ancestor).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After <em>collapsing</em> operation, paths that are different in three
trees are left in non-zero stages.  At this point, you can
inspect the index file with this command:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 7f8b141b65fdcee47321e399a2598a235a032422 0       example
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In our example of only two files, we did not have unchanged
files so only <em>example</em> resulted in collapsing.  But in real-life
large projects, when only a small number of files change in one commit,
this <em>collapsing</em> tends to trivially merge most of the paths
fairly quickly, leaving only a handful of real changes in non-zero
stages.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To look at only non-zero stages, use <code>--unmerged</code> flag:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git ls-files --unmerged
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The next step of merging is to merge these three versions of the
file, using 3-way merge.  This is done by giving
<em>git merge-one-file</em> command as one of the arguments to
<em>git merge-index</em> command:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello
Auto-merging hello
ERROR: Merge conflict in hello
fatal: merge program failed</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>git merge-one-file</em> script is called with parameters to
describe those three versions, and is responsible to leave the
merge results in the working tree.
It is a fairly straightforward shell script, and
eventually calls <em>merge</em> program from RCS suite to perform a
file-level 3-way merge.  In this case, <em>merge</em> detects
conflicts, and the merge result with conflict marks is left in
the working tree..  This can be seen if you run <code>ls-files
--stage</code> again at this point:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 7f8b141b65fdcee47321e399a2598a235a032422 0       example
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the state of the index file and the working file after
<em>git merge</em> returns control back to you, leaving the conflicting
merge for you to resolve.  Notice that the path <code>hello</code> is still
unmerged, and what you see with <em>git diff</em> at this point is
differences since stage 2 (i.e. your version).</p></div>

<h2 id="_working_with_others">Working with Others</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Although Git is a truly distributed system, it is often
convenient to organize your project with an informal hierarchy
of developers. Linux kernel development is run this way. There
is a nice illustration (page 17, "Merges to Mainline") in
<a href="http://www.xenotime.net/linux/mentor/linux-mentoring-2006.pdf">Randy Dunlap&#8217;s presentation</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It should be stressed that this hierarchy is purely <strong>informal</strong>.
There is nothing fundamental in Git that enforces the "chain of

<div class="paragraph"><p>A recommended workflow for a "project lead" goes like this:</p></div>

</p>
</li>
<li>

<div class="paragraph"><p>If other people are pulling from your repository over dumb
transport protocols (HTTP), you need to keep this repository
<em>dumb transport friendly</em>.  After <code>git init</code>,
<code>$GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update.sample</code> copied from the standard templates
would contain a call to <em>git update-server-info</em>
but you need to manually enable the hook with
<code>mv post-update.sample post-update</code>.  This makes sure
<em>git update-server-info</em> keeps the necessary files up-to-date.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Push into the public repository from your primary
   repository.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>git repack</em> the public repository. This establishes a big
   pack that contains the initial set of objects as the
   baseline, and possibly <em>git prune</em> if the transport
   used for pulling from your repository supports packed
   repositories.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Keep working in your primary repository. Your changes
   include modifications of your own, patches you receive via
   e-mails, and merges resulting from pulling the "public"
   repositories of your "subsystem maintainers".
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can repack this private repository whenever you feel like.</p></div>

<li>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that you should not do Octopus just because you can.  An octopus
is a valid thing to do and often makes it easier to view the
commit history if you are merging more than two independent
changes at the same time.  However, if you have merge conflicts
with any of the branches you are merging in and need to hand
resolve, that is an indication that the development happened in
those branches were not independent after all, and you should
merge two at a time, documenting how you resolved the conflicts,
and the reason why you preferred changes made in one side over
the other.  Otherwise it would make the project history harder
to follow, not easier.</p></div>
